Every time a class object is instantiated, which is when we declare a variable, a new object is initiated from scratch. Whereas in Python, Modules are simply files with the . py extension containing Python code that can be imported inside another Python Program. In simple terms, we can consider a module to be the same as a code library or a file that contains a set of functions/Classes that we want to include in our application."
